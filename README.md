You will prototype a new semantic recommendation feature for an e-commerce website's fashion product line using the OpenAI API. The service will provide an interactive chat experience where users can have natural conversations about their fashion needs, rather than just receiving search results.

Key features:

- Natural language chat interface using OpenAI's GPT models
- Contextual product recommendations based on user's needs and preferences
- Ability to ask follow-up questions and refine recommendations
- Integration with product catalog for accurate, real-time suggestions

Example conversation:
User: "I need an outfit to go to the beach this summer"
Assistant: "I'll help you find the perfect beach outfit! Are you looking for something casual or dressy?"
User: "Casual and comfortable"
Assistant: _Recommends relevant beach-appropriate items with explanations_

You will expose this functionality through a chat-based API endpoint, with an optional front-end demo showing the conversational shopping experience. The system should maintain context throughout the conversation to provide increasingly personalized recommendations.
